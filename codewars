Description:
Upon arriving at an interview, you are presented with a solid blue cube. The cube is then dipped in red paint, coating the entire surface of the cube. The interviewer then proceeds to cut through the cube in all three dimensions a certain number of times.

Your function takes as parameter the number of times the cube has been cut. You must return the number of smaller cubes created by the cuts that have at least one red face.

To make it clearer, the picture below represents the cube after (from left to right) 0, 1 and 2 cuts have been made.
for example:
If we cut the cube 2 times, the function should return 26
If we cut the cube 4 times, the function should return 98

solution:
function countSquares(cuts){
  if(cuts == 0){
    return 1;
  } else if(cuts == 1){
    return 8;
  } else {
 return ((cuts + 1) * cuts * 4 + 2 * ((cuts + 1) * (cuts + 1) - cuts * 4))}
  }


You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

solution
function updateLight(current) {
  if (current == "green"){
    return "yellow";
  }else if(current == "yellow"){
    return "red";
  }else if(current == "red"){
    return "green";
  }

}
A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

Return true if yes, false otherwise :)

Solution
function hero(bullets, dragons){
  let chances = bullets/dragons;
  if (chances >= 2){
    return true;//Get Coding!
} else if (dragons == 0){
  return true;
} else {
  return false;
}}
