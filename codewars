Description:
Upon arriving at an interview, you are presented with a solid blue cube. The cube is then dipped in red paint, coating the entire surface of the cube. The interviewer then proceeds to cut through the cube in all three dimensions a certain number of times.

Your function takes as parameter the number of times the cube has been cut. You must return the number of smaller cubes created by the cuts that have at least one red face.

To make it clearer, the picture below represents the cube after (from left to right) 0, 1 and 2 cuts have been made.
for example:
If we cut the cube 2 times, the function should return 26
If we cut the cube 4 times, the function should return 98

solution:
function countSquares(cuts){
  if(cuts == 0){
    return 1;
  } else if(cuts == 1){
    return 8;
  } else {
 return ((cuts + 1) * cuts * 4 + 2 * ((cuts + 1) * (cuts + 1) - cuts * 4))}
  }


You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

solution
function updateLight(current) {
  if (current == "green"){
    return "yellow";
  }else if(current == "yellow"){
    return "red";
  }else if(current == "red"){
    return "green";
  }

A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

Return true if yes, false otherwise :)

Solution:
function hero(bullets, dragons){
  let chances = bullets/dragons;
  if (chances >= 2){
    return true;//Get Coding!
} else if (dragons == 0){
  return true;
} else {
  return false;
}}


Our football team has finished the championship.

Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Points are awarded for each match as follows:

if x > y: 3 points (win)
if x < y: 0 points (loss)
if x = y: 1 point (tie)
We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.

Notes:

our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
0 <= x <= 4
0 <= y <= 4

Solution:
function points(games) {
  let score = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    let results = games[i].split(":");
    let our = parseInt(results[0]);
    let notOur = parseInt(results[1]);
    if(our > notOur){
      score += 3;
    } else if (our < notOur){
      score +=0;
    } else {
      score += 1;
    }
}
  return score;
}


Create a function which compares two probabilities, returning true if the first one is most likely otherwise false.

For this exercise probability is expressed as two numbers separated by a colon e.g. a probability of 1 in 3 will be 1:3.

So:

Input: ('1:3','1:2') - returns false as 1 in 3 is less likely than 1 in 2.


solution:
function mostLikely(prob1,prob2){
  let firstResult = prob1.split(":");
  let secondResult = prob2.split(":");
  if((parseInt(firstResult[0]) / parseInt(firstResult[1])) > (parseInt(secondResult[0]) / parseInt(secondResult[1]))){
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }

}

Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.

Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need. If n < 0 or m < 0 return 0.

Example:
n= 5, m=5: 25
n=-5, m=5:  0
Waiting for translations and Feedback! Thanks!

Solution

function paperwork(n, m) {
  if(n<0 || m<0){
    return 0;
  } else {
    return n * m;
  }
}


Write a function that returns a string in which firstname is swapped with last name.

Example(Input --> Output)

"john McClane" --> "McClane john"

Solution

function nameShuffler(str){
  var nameArray = str.split(" ");
  var answer = nameArray[1] + " " + nameArray[0];
  answer
  return answer;
  //Shuffle It
}
